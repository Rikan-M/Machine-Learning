# 📦 BatchRegressor

**BatchRegressor** is a lightweight, custom-built linear regression model implemented from scratch using only NumPy. It supports training using **mini-batch gradient descent**, making it a great educational tool for understanding the inner workings of machine learning models without relying on external ML libraries.
